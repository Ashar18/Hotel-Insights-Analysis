# Hotel Insights Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a Hotel Insights Analysis dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into hotel data, focusing on the year 2016 for Resort hotels with additional insights for other years also.


## Problem Statement
We have a hotel dataset containing Resort and City hotel data from 2015-2017. Our central interest is to gain insights from the year 2016 under Resort hotels. We also seek to understand cancellation levels, average daily rates, and the comparison of revenue made to revenue lost on a monthly basis.

## Data
The data used in this project includes:
- **Hotel Table**: Fact table containing detailed hotel data for both Resort and City hotels from 2015 to 2017.
- **Calendar Table**: Dimension table created through a query to provide a comprehensive date dimension for time-based analysis.


## Measures
The following measures were created using DAX to facilitate analysis and visualization:
- Total Revenue
- Total Revenue Lost
- Total Cancellation
- Percentage Cancellation
- Average Daily Rate
- Total Transactions
